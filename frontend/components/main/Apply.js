            We will ask you to deposit the value of the ticket ($300) using
            cryptocurrency tokens with us for the time of the conference. As
            these tickets were sponsored by Web3Hubs, we kindly ask you to
            participate in 2 mandatory events. At each of these events, you will
            receive a POAP. Please make sure to get these POAPs as they are the
            preconditions for you to receive your staked tokens. Additionally,
            install the APP if you havenâ€™t done so yet.
          </p>
          <h2>Who can apply</h2>
          <p>
            As these tickets are supposed to go to women and non-binary people,
            we will ask you some questions and share links to your social media
            platforms.
